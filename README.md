#  EXPERIMENT 13
# AIM
To study and implement constructor overloading
# THEORY
In C++, a method known as constructor overloading enables a class to have multiple constructors, each with a unique set of parameters. Because of this, objects of the class can be initialized differently based on the kind and quantity of arguments handed in when creating the object. <BR>
* Rules for Constructor Overloading: <BR>
  * The quantity and kind of parameters used by the constructors must vary.
  * The parameter types cannot be the same in the same order for them.
  * It is possible to call the constructors explicitly or implicitly.
